  \caption{Shown are the gravitational-wave observations from the full search on data from O1-O3 with $\mathcal{P}_{\textrm{astro}} > 0.5$ or IFAR $>$ 100 years sorted by observation time. We list the GPS time for each event alongside information on the observational status of the three observatories LIGO Hanford (H), LIGO Livingston (L), and Virgo (V). We also list the detectors for which our search triggered and the corresponding recovered SNRs ($\rho$). For some events, where multiple detectors are operational, the search does not trigger for all observatories. This is caused by requiring consistency of the triggers between detectors and triggers in individual detectors needing to exceed the SNR threshold. For multi-detector events we provide the IFAR at the associated ranking statistic for the event. The probability of astrophysical origin is estimated for all events detected by the focused BBH search and from the single-detector analyses. Events reported here for the first time are marked by bold font.}
